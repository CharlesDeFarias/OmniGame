# OmniGame — project ledger

Canonical state for any session working on this project. Keep this file and `docs/DECISIONS.md` current after every work session.

## What this is

A personal omnibus of ad-free, non-exploitative casual games. First MVP: a Royal Match-style match-3 for Charles's sister Luana (Down syndrome, ~2nd-grade reading, strong comprehension). Theme: an adult living their life and leveling up — subtle nudges toward independence. Fun first, always.

## Current state

- **Phase:** plan 1 of 4 written (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-01-match3-logic-core.md`) — awaiting execution. Plans 2-4 (simulator, Phaser+PWA, meta-layer) not yet written.
- **Luana narrative skin:** famous influencer managed by brother Charles (personal layer only; decision #19).
- **Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-omnigame-match3-design.md`
- **Code:** none yet.

## How Charles works

- Concise communication. Decisions + playable builds — he doesn't read code.
- Full superpowers discipline: spec → plan → TDD → code review.
- Two-layer principle in everything: Luana's personal/simple layer on top, generic/configurable public layer built underneath (theme packs, text tiers, profiles).

## Key constraints

- Logic cores are pure TypeScript, zero Phaser imports. Presentation is a thin, swappable Phaser layer.
- All randomness through a seeded RNG (deterministic core). Levels are JSON data, calibrated by a headless simulator.
- MVP cut: kitchen chapter + one furnishable room. Assets: CC0 (tracked in LICENSES.md). Perf target: mid-range Android 2022+.
